/**
 * Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.
 * A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds,
 *  and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time.
 * The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.
 * For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms.
 * The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms.
 * If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.
 * The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events.
 * Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.
 * Please solve it without using lodash's _.debounce() function.
